# How to do this kata

The test harness already exists in this repo. If you would like to start
from scratch, feel free to delete the test! If you'd like to jump straight into
the refactoring, do the following:

1. Read `GildedRoseRequirements.txt` carefully.
2. Install the dependencies using `poetry install`.
3. Run `pytest-watch` in a terminal on the side with the command `ptw`. Tests will now autorun on save.
4. Get refactoring! Remember to make incremental changes that do not break the tests.
   Try to commit every time you take a step in the right direction.

Have fun!
